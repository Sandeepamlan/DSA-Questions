Question Name: Matrix XOR

Problem Statement

Antonio and Sherlock each have an array of length N. Letâ€™s say Antonio has array A, and Sherlock has array B.

Because they are friends, they decided to merge these arrays into a matrix C. Matrix C has N rows and N columns. The element in the ith row and jth column is the sum of the ith element of array A and jth element of array B.

Now they want to know the Bitwise XOR of all elements of array C. Help them in finding it!

Input Format

First line contains a single integer denoting N.
Next line contains N space separated integers denoting elements of array A.
Next line contains N space separated integers denoting elements of array B.
Output Format

Print the Bitwise XOR of all elements of array C.
Constraints

1<=N<=10^5
1<=Ai, Bi<=10^5
Sample Input 1

3

2 4 8

1 2 3

Sample Output 1

14

Explanation of Sample 1

Array C = [2+1 2+2 2+3] = [3 4 5]

[4+1 4+2 4+3] [5 6 7]

[8+1 8+2 8+3] [9 10 11]

Now XOR of all elements = 3^4^5^5^6^7^9^10^11 = 14
