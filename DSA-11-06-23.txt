Mini Median

Problem Statement

 

Given an array A consisting of N integers. N is guaranteed to be even.

Median of an array B of length L is defined as the (L+1)/2th largest value present in the array.

Like median of array [5,1,2,4,3] = 3, array [1,1,2,4,5] = 2 and so on.

You are allowed to remove exactly one integer from the given array. Print the minimum possible median of the final array obtained by deleting exactly one element from array A.

 

Input Format

 

First line contains a single integer denoting N.
Next line contains N space separated integers denoting the elements of array A.
 

Output Format

 

Print the minimum possible median of the final array obtained by deleting exactly one element from array A.
 

Constraints

 

1<=N<=10^5
1<=Ai<=10^9
 

Sample Input 1

 

4

2 4 4 3

 

Sample Output 1

 

3

 

Explanation of Sample 1

 

If we delete the 3rd element, i.e 4 , array becomes = [2,4,3]. Median of this array = 3.
