The next line contains N space separated integers denoting array S.

Constraints

Sample Input 1



5



3 4 1 5 2





Sample Output 1



3



Explanation of Sample 1



Initially third is the only inferior minion in the line.



If we train and increase the strength of the third minion by 2, then S becomes = [3,4,3,5,2].



By doing this the fifth minion becomes inferior and hence we train him and increase its strength by 1 making S = [3,4,3,5,3]. Now there are no inferior minions and the cost is 3.
